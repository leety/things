    TranslatableAdmin
    -----------------
    This is the base Admin class provided by Parler. It provides almost perfect
    compatibility with the normal way of declaring an admin class. There are
    some exceptions though, as noted inline below.

    VersionedPlaceholderAdminMixin
    ------------------------------
    This is provided by Aldryn Reversion and provides nearly all the
    revision-magic in a single mixin.

    PlaceholderAdminMixin
    ---------------------
    This is already an ancestor of ``VersionedPlaceholderAdmin``, so, if your
    model is already using ``VersionedPlaceholderAdminMixin`` there is no need
    to also add ``PlaceholderAdminMixin``. However, if your project is not
    revisioned, and you do have ``PlaceholderField`` fields defined, then you
    must add this mixin to your model.

    FrontendEditableAdminMixin
    --------------------------
    If you plan to use {% render_model â€¦ %} (or a variant), in your templates,
    you should add ``FrontendEditableAdminMixin`` to your Admin form.

    AllTranslationsMixin
    --------------------
    The ``AllTranslationsMixin`` will add a set of click-able language "tags"
    in the last column of the changelist-obj that are hyper-linked to the
    object's change-form in the indicated language. They also serve to visually
    communicate (via color) which translations are available. If you wish to
    reposition this to another column (not recommended), simply place the field
    "all_translations" wherever you like in the ``list_display`` tuple.
